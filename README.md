# EpikInteractions.py
## What is it?
--------------
EpikInteractions.py is a library for handling HTTP Interactions for Discord's API Wrapper, removing the need to use the Websocket Connection, and being very light.

## How to use it?
------------------
Currently we're working it, give it a week.

## Where are the docs?
I'll be working on docstrings from the start, and then utilise them for docs. Even if you don't have access to the docs, you should be able to use the library.

## What happened to EpikCord.py?
Nothing. This is a more lightweight library because we don't wrap ***everything***.

You will require Python 3.10 or above.
