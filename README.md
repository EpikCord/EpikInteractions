# EpikInteractions.py
## What is it?
--------------
EpikInteractions.py is an ultra lightweight library for handling HTTP Interactions for Discord's API Wrapper, removing the need to use the Websocket Connection, and being very light.

## How to use it?
------------------
Currently we're working it, give it a week.

## Where are the docs?
I'll be working on docstrings from the start, and then utilise them for docs. Even if you don't have access to the docs, you should be able to use the library.


> Note: This is an extremely lightweight library so it lacks on terms of functions.If you want the full feature set and don't care about speed, use [`EpikCord.py`](https://github.com/EpikCord/EpikCord.py)

You will require Python 3.10 or above.
